Hello everyone!! My name is Mihai and currently I am a Computer Science student at Technical University of Cluj-Napoca. 
I started to learn a little bit of programming when i was in highschool and I immediately enjoyed it. 
I hope that in the future i could work with a team of developers and create all sorts of apps and softwares, while also having a lot of fun.
At the moment I am interested in improving my programming skills and gaining experience in the developer world.
